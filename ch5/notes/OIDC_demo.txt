Auth0

1. Create Machine-to-Machine application via the UI or CLI (see commands)
2. Authorize the app to access the Auth0 Management API
3. Create an .env file

4. Add callback URLs - first one is the callback for the UI, the second for the CLI; you can use just one, if don't need the other
http://localhost:8200/ui/vault/auth/oidc/oidc/callback,
http://localhost:8250/oidc/callback
